        "explanation": "The claim asks if Palash cheated on Smriti. While evidence from Free Press Journal (2025-11-28T07:18:13+00:00) mentions 'Link-Up Rumours With Palash Muchhal Amid Cheating Controversy' involving choreographer Gulnaaz Khan, and Republic World (2025-11-28T10:59:12+00:00) references a 'Palaash Muchhal-Smriti Mandhana Wedding Controversy' where choreographers 'come clean,' none of the provided evidence confirms that Palash Muchhal actually cheated on Smriti Mandhana. On the contrary, more recent evidence from News18 (2025-11-28T10:35:14+00:00) and Times of India (2025-11-28T10:24:00+00:00) explicitly states that the couple's wedding was postponed 'due to family health emergencies' and that 'plans remain on track,' with Palash's mother confirming 'Dono takleef mein hai, shadi jaldi hogi' (Both are in distress, the wedding will happen soon). This directly contradicts the idea that cheating caused any disruption or breakdown in their relationship or wedding plans."
    },
    "true_news": "The evidence indicates that Palash Muchhal and Smriti Mandhana are in a relationship and were planning to get married. Their wedding was postponed due to family and personal health emergencies, and their plans to marry are still on track. There were 'link-up rumours' and a 'cheating controversy' involving Palash Muchhal and choreographer Gulnaaz Khan, which Gulnaaz Khan addressed by asking for respect, but the evidence does not confirm that Palash actually cheated.",
