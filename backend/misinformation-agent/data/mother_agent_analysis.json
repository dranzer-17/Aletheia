        "topic": "The user's claim asks if Palash cheated on Smriti. The collected evidence, primarily from November 28, 2025, indicates that Smriti Mandhana and Palash Muchhal are in a relationship and were planning to get married. Evidence Item 4 (News18, 2025-11-28) explicitly states their wedding was postponed \"due to family health emergencies,\" with plans remaining on track. This is corroborated by Evidence Item 5 (Times of India, 2025-11-28), where Palash's mother states, 'Dono takleef mein hai, shadi jaldi hogi' (Both are in distress, the wedding will happen soon), referring to health issues. While Evidence Item 3 (Republic World, 2025-11-28) mentions a 'Palaash Muchhal-Smriti Mandhana Wedding Controversy' and choreographers 'coming clean,' the content provided does not link this controversy to infidelity or cheating. Instead, the evidence consistently points to a planned wedding that was temporarily put on hold for health-related reasons. There is no information in the provided evidence to suggest that Palash cheated on Smriti."
