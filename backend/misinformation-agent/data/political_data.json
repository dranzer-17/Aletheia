[...] \"It's eerily similar,\" said Michael Strain, head of economic policy studies at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. \"The mistake that they're both making is not accepting the fact of life, the fact of politics - that the American people really care about prices going up rapidly.\" [...] Trump may now be making some of the same mistakes as Biden, including downplaying the impact of higher prices on households and looking to corporate investments to boost jobs and wages, a strategy that takes years to pan out.\n\nSign uphere.",

[...] What Biden did: Mr Biden is said to be one of the presidents rely most on parole, a practice which has existed since the 1950s. That has prompted fierce criticism from Republicans and Trump.\n\nThe use of parole by the Biden administration includes the humanitarian parole of migrants who have been detained, in particular when they are found to have a credible fear of persecution or torture in their home country. [...] What Trump did: Trump made little use of parole - where the government allows migrants into the US even if they don't have a visa or can't qualify for one - compared to President Biden.\n\nInstead, his administration led an effort to decrease the number of migrants on parole in the US and in 2018 announced the creation of the MPP programme, or \"Remain in Mexico\".\n\nTrump has said on the campaign trail that he would end the \"outrageous abuse of parole\" by President Biden.",

One recent analysis showed that Trump said or wrote the name Biden at least 580 times in those first 100 days in office. Having claimed that rises in share prices were \"Trump's stock market\" at work, he later blamed sharp falls in share prices on \"Biden's stock market\". [...] When he first arrived in the Oval Office, Biden hung a portrait of America's wartime leader Franklin D. Roosevelt on the wall. He was born two and a half years before the defeat of the Nazis, into the world FDR helped to create - a world of American global leadership and solidarity. But the United States voted to reject Biden's policies and values and instead to endorse Donald Trump's call to put America First.\n\nThe world is changing from what people like Joe Biden have taken for granted. [...] In a dark blue suit, the former president arrives smiling and relaxed but with the determined air of a man on a mission. It's his first interview since leaving the White House, and he seems most angry about Donald Trump's treatment of America's allies - in particular Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky.",
