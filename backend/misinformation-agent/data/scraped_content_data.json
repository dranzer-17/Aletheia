But the 27 years thing was a direct comparison to IT and nobody is talking about it.\n\n# Related Answers Section\n\nSteve Harrington's relationship with kids in Stranger Things is a central part of his character development, transforming him from a high school jock into a beloved parental figure. Here's a succinct guide summarizing redditors' opinions on this unique dynamic:\n\n### Steve's Accidental Parenthood\n\n**From Jock to Babysitter**: Steve's journey from a popular jock to a reluctant babysitter is a significant character arc. [\"Steve Harrington copes by adopting four middle-schoolers, babysitting the town, and becoming the most emotionally stable 'single mom' Hawkins has ever produced.\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/StrangerThings/comments/1ppdml7/steve_harrington_turning_breakups_into_accidental/)\n\n**Embracing the Role**: Despite initial reluctance, Steve grows to embrace his role as a protector and caregiver. [\"I love too that even though we saw him taking care of some of the kids at different points in S2 and S3, he still clearly isn\u2019t fully into it yet even in S4 ('Always the babysitter! Always the GODDAMN BABYSITTER!') but then he really starts to embrace it.\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/StrangerThings/comments/1q1yrwn/comment/nxbsj5k/)\n\n### Favorite \"Nuggets\"\n\n**Dustin's Special Bond**: Steve's relationship with Dustin Henderson is particularly highlighted. [\"we all know that dustin is his favorite little nugget.\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/StrangerThings/comments/vqja1j/comment/iepg37c/)\n\n**The \"Six Nuggets\"**: Steve's protective nature extends to the entire group of younger kids, often referred to as his \"nuggets.\" [\"Give Steve his six nuggets!!!\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/StrangerThings/comments/vqja1j/comment/iepicxu/)\n\n### Character Transformation\n\n**Emotional Maturity**: Steve's interactions with the kids help him develop emotional maturity and a sense of purpose. [\"Out of all of the young adults, Steve somehow seemed to come out being the most emotionally mature and content imo.\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/StrangerThings/comments/1q1ewob/a_note_on_steve_harringtons_ending/)\n\n**Finding His Calling**: He discovers a job he loves that enables him to help kids, which he finds meaningful. [\"He has a job he loves that enables him to help kids, which he finds meaningful.\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/StrangerThings/comments/1q1ewob/a_note_on_steve_harringtons_ending/)\n\n### Future Aspirations\n\n**Simple Desires**: Steve's future aspirations are simple but fulfilling: a family, a home, and a job where he can make a difference. [\"There is nothing wrong with wanting a big family and a house that overlooks a forest and wife he adores.\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/StrangerThings/comments/1q1ewob/comment/nx5rptz/)\n\n**Contentment in His Hometown**: He is content with staying in his hometown and building a life there. [\"He\u2019s the hometown hero. He wasn\u2019t made to do greater things, he\u2019s just kind of a simple guy and he\u2019s content with that.\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/StrangerThings/comments/1q1ewob/comment/nx53byn/)\n\n### Parental Figures\n\n**Absent Parents**: Steve's own parents are largely absent and emotionally distant, which may have contributed to his desire to be a better parental figure. [\"They sound like the classic 'rich parents who care more about status and image than their actual kid'.\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/StrangerThings/comments/1pfqzrw/comment/nslooq4/)\n\nFor more discussions and insights, consider visiting these subreddits:\n\n[r/StrangerThings](https://www.reddit.com/r/StrangerThings/)\n\n[r/CharacterArcs](https://www.reddit.com/r/CharacterArcs/)\n\n[r/Television](https://www.reddit.com/r/Television/)\n\nCreate your account and connect with a world of communities.\n\n![Mike](https://emoji.redditmedia.com/2jh7xrutoyv01_t5_3adlm/Mike)\n![Mike](https://emoji.redditmedia.com/2jh7xrutoyv01_t5_3adlm/Mike)\n\nI believe.\n\nAnyone can view, post, and comment to this community\n\n![](https://id.rlcdn.com/472486.gif)",

Full Death List, Ending Breakdown & Does Eleven Die? (2026)\n\n![](https://matricbiharboard.com/wp-content/cache/flying-press/gravatar-e63cf6b477ac.png)\n\n**Who dies in Stranger Things Season 5** is the biggest fandom question of 2026, and the explosive final episode delivers emotional shocks, heroic sacrifices, and the complete end of the Upside Down conflict. Season 5 closes the Hawkins story with a destructive last battle that permanently changes the fate of key characters and the world they live in.\n\nThis in-depth guide explains **every confirmed death**, debatable outcomes, the meaning of the finale, and answers the most searched question: **Does Eleven die in Stranger Things Season 5?**\n\n![IRS Approves $2,000 Direct Deposit January 2026](https://matricbiharboard.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IRS-Approves-2000-Direct-Deposit-for-January-2026-1024x576.webp)\n\n*This article contains full Season 5 finale spoilers.*\n\n## **The Final Battle in Stranger Things Season 5: How the Ending Sets Up the Deaths**\n\nSeason 5 builds toward the last confrontation in the Upside Down. Vecna attempts a final merge between the real world and the alternate dimension, threatening a permanent open gate and irreversible collapse of Hawkins.\n\nKey elements leading to deaths:\n\n![Stranger Things 5 | Finale Trailer | Netflix](https://matricbiharboard.com/wp-content/cache/flying-press/8bd47c3336ade61b18b445965918c4a7.jpg)\n\n\nThis setup creates the conditions for the most deaths in the series so far.\n\n### **Who Dies in Stranger Things Season 5? (Confirmed Death List)**\n\n| Character | Cause of Death | Story Purpose |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Vecna (Henry Creel)** | Killed by Eleven, Will\u2019s mind-link, and Joyce\u2019s finishing strike | Ends the supernatural source permanently |\n| **Mind Flayer** | Dissolves when Vecna dies, linked to his existence | Closes the chapter of the Upside Down |\n| **Kali \u201cEight\u201d Prasad** | Shot protecting Eleven and Hopper | Emotional cost + symbolic sacrifice |\n| **Multiple Upside Down Soldiers/Demons** | Destroyed in the battle | War environment realism |\n\nThese are the **only confirmed complete deaths**. Nobody from the \u201cmain kid group\u201d dies outright \u2014 but the cost is still incredibly high.\n\n### **Detailed Analysis of Major Deaths (Scene by Scene)**\n\n#### 1. **Vecna\u2019s Death \u2014 The Final Execution**\n\n**Who kills Vecna?**\n\nThis is the most symbolic death:\n\n**Why his death matters:**  \nWith Vecna gone, the Upside Down loses direction, purpose, and identity.\n\n#### 2. **Mind Flayer \u2014 A Death by Association**\n\nThe Mind Flayer\u2019s existence relied on Vecna\u2019s psychic channel. When Vecna dies:\n\nThis moment confirms that there is **no future villain** waiting in the shadows.\n\n**Why it matters for story:**  \nStranger Things never needs a Season 6 \u2014 the circle is officially closed.\n\n#### 3. **Kali (Eight) \u2014 The Most Emotional Sacrifice**\n\nKali\u2019s death is the emotional turning point of the finale. She steps in front of a fatal attack meant for Eleven, proving:\n\nHer death leaves viewers with a strong symbolic message:  \n**Eleven\u2019s origin is marked by trauma, but her future doesn\u2019t have to be.**\n\n### **Does Eleven Die in Stranger Things Season 5? (Explained)**\n\n#### **Eleven\u2019s Death Scene**\n\nEleven\u2019s final power surge collapses the Upside Down from within. She appears to disintegrate in the gate and her body isn\u2019t recovered. The show *frames* it like death.\n\n#### **18-Month Time Jump: Why Fans Disagree**\n\nThe final episode jumps forward **18 months**. During a Dungeons & Dragons session:\n\nThe show never confirms her death. There is **no grave. No funeral. No memorial.**\n\n#### **The Most Likely Theory**\n\nEleven:\n\n**Final Interpretation:**  \n**Eleven is alive \u2014 but officially missing.**  \nDead to the world, alive to the narrative.  \nShe becomes a myth, not a martyr.\n\nThis ending balances **closure + hope**.\n\n### **So\u2026 Who Actually Survives?**\n\n| Character | Final Status | Ending Note |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Mike | Alive | Believes El is out there |\n| Will | Alive | Finally emotionally free |\n| Dustin | Alive | Protecting Hawkins community |\n| Lucas & Max | Alive | Max continues to recover |\n| Steve | Alive | Uninjured; emotional closure |\n| Nancy & Jonathan | Alive | Relationship healing |\n| Hopper & Joyce | Alive | Emotional central figures |\n\nSeason 5 gives every survivor a **purposeful conclusion**.\n\n### **Why Stranger Things Needed These Deaths**\n\nThe deaths are not shock value \u2014 they serve narrative repair:\n\nEleven\u2019s ambiguous ending prevents the series from becoming tragedy-only and preserves global fan investment.\n\n### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n### **Who dies in Stranger Things Season 5 overall?**\n\nVecna, Mind Flayer, Kali, and unnamed forces in the Upside Down.\n\n### **Does Eleven die in Season 5?**\n\nNot confirmed. The show suggests an escape; the ending is open.\n\n### **Is Steve Harrington dead?**\n\nNo \u2014 he survives.\n\n### **Is Hawkins saved?**\n\nYes, but it will never return to \u201cnormal.\u201d The town lives with scars.\n\n### **Could Eleven return someday?**\n\nCreatively, yes. Narratively, she doesn\u2019t need to.\n\n![](https://matricbiharboard.com/wp-content/cache/flying-press/gravatar-2ee337869d6a.png)\n\n## Post navigation\n\n###### Previous Post\n\n![Recetas F\u00e1ciles para Nochevieja](https://matricbiharboard.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Recetas-Faciles-para-Nochevieja-150x150.webp)\n\n###### Next Post\n\n![Mega da Virada 2026](https://matricbiharboard.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Mega-da-Virada-2026-150x150.webp)\n\n### Comments\n\nNo comments yet.

Joe Keery as Steve Harrington in Stranger Things: Season 5. Cr. COURTESY OF NETFLIX \u00a9 2025](https://www.denofgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Stranger-Things-Season-5-Joe-Keery-Steve-Harrington.jpg?resize=768%2C432) \n\n*Photo: Netflix*\n\n*This article contains spoilers for the\u00a0**Stranger Things**series finale.*\n\nLots of things went down (or Upside Down) in the *[Stranger Things](https://www.denofgeek.com/stranger-things/)* series finale, from the reappearance of the Mind Flayer and Vecna\u2019s death to Eleven\u2019s (apparent?) sacrifice and even the gang\u2019s high school graduation. The final episode\u2019s nearly hour-long epilogue takes us into the final battle\u2019s aftermath, running down the fates and futures of pretty much every major character before passing the torch \u2014 and the *Dungeons & Dragons* game \u2014 to a literal new generation. It\u2019s heartwarming, bittersweet, and hopeful by turns, and (for the most part at least, if we ignore the Eleven of it all) as satisfying as anyone could have hoped for.\n\nLucas and Max finally get their movie date. Dustin resurrects Hellfire to tell the system to go [expletive] itself one last time. Joyce and Hopper get engaged. Will (presumably) moves to a city that actually has an active queer nightlife. Mike keeps telling stories, of both the fictional and the perhaps not-so-much variety. Nancy drops out of college to chase her journalism dreams, while Jonathan sets out to make what sounds like the most pretentious horror movie on Earth. Everyone appears to be relatively happy and surprisingly well-adjusted, even if most are wrestling with the same bittersweet existential questions that most young people face at such a major transition point in their lives. But only one character appears to be genuinely thriving, both confident in his own identity and secure in the choices he\u2019s made: Steve Harrington.\n\nSteve\u2019s journey over the course of *Stranger Things\u2019* five seasons is a fairly remarkable one \u2014 particularly considering that he [originally wasn\u2019t even supposed to survive its first](https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/stranger-things-creators-reveal-which-fan-favorites-almost-got-killed/). A literal zero-to-hero narrative on steroids, Steve\u2019s evolution from selfish jerk to selfless leader is a deeply satisfying ode to the power and possibility of change, a reminder that we can all be something more today than we were yesterday. That he should wind up with the show\u2019s most satisfying ending feels not just right, but earned, a payoff for the years of work he\u2019s done to become something more than he once was \u2014 a better leader, a better friend, a better *person*.\n\nAd\n\nAd \u2013 content continues below\n\nSure, on paper, it may not seem like much. Steve, after all, not only stays in Hawkins when characters like Nancy, Jonathan, Robin, and Will leave their former lives behind, but he\u2019s literally still employed at the high school they all once attended. But arrested development this is not. In fact, Steve is the character who, by the story\u2019s end, seems most at peace with himself, who is content in a way that it\u2019s not entirely clear any other character on the series\u2019 canvas has yet managed to achieve. Perhaps this is because the events of *Stranger Things* have already required Steve to confront the person he\u2019s been and the one he wants to become in more direct ways than some of his friends, or maybe it\u2019s just because he\u2019s the kind of person who was always meant for a simpler kind of life. Either way, it works.\n\nYet, while Steve\u2019s life is perhaps smaller than he once thought it would turn out to be, it\u2019s rich in meaning (and apparently also cash, if he\u2019s already planning to buy real estate at the ripe old age of *maybe* 20 years old). He\u2019s a teacher and a coach, helping to shape the youth of Hawkins in ways that are less directly related to the potential end of the world but that are no less impactful.\n\n![STRANGER THINGS: SEASON 5. Joe Keery as Steve Harrington in Stranger Things: Season 5. Cr. COURTESY OF NETFLIX \u00a9 2025]()\n\nIt\u2019s not an accident that pretty much every kid on his baseball team is one of the 12 Vecna kidnapped, meaning that Steve is *still* shepherding and protecting those who need his help. (His six nuggets have essentially become a dozen at this point.) He\u2019s going on road trips with Dustin during his summer college breaks. He\u2019s dating, frequently and unsuccessfully it seems, but still with an eye toward settling down. (Presumably, he still wants those six nuggets of his own.) And despite everything that\u2019s happened there, he\u2019s still able to see the beauty in Hawkins, enough that he never seems to have even considered making his life elsewhere.\n\nThere\u2019s plenty of stuff to nitpick when it comes to the ways that the Duffer brothers chose to wrap up this show. (See also: Eleven\u2019s ambitious disappearance, the inexplicable MacGuffin space rock that corrupted Henry, [the over-the-top violence of Vecna\u2019s death.](https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/stranger-things-climactic-battle-went-too-far/)) But the fact that the show does so right by one of its most beloved fan favorites goes a long way to making this finale a success, even if it might leave you wondering why everyone couldn\u2019t be afforded this same treatment.\n\nAd\n\n*All of Stranger Things is now streaming on Netflix.*\n\nComment:\n\nAd\n\n## More on Stranger Things\n\n![STRANGER THINGS: SEASON 5.

So, even if they are to succeed, there\u2019s a big question mark in terms of what\u2019s going to happen to Eleven.\u201d\n\n[Solve word, logic, and visual puzzles based on Stranger Things\n\nStart Solving](/tudum/puzzled/event/stranger_things)\n\nMeanwhile, at the Creel House in Camazotz, Vecna ([aka Henry Creel)](https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/stranger-things-season-5-cast-character-guide) has gathered his kidnapped children to cast a powerful spell that will set his ominous plan in motion.\n\nIn the last [*Stranger Things*](https://www.netflix.com/tudum/stranger-things) episode \u2014\u00a0The Finale, arriving on New Year\u2019s Eve at 5 p.m. PT \u2014\u00a0the crew faces the most powerful darkness it has ever known. Keep reading for a deep dive into Volume 2 of *Stranger Things 5*, now streaming only on Netflix.\n\n### What is Vecna\u2019s ultimate plan?\n\nHenry reveals in [Episode 4](https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/stranger-things-season-5-episode-4-explained) that he intends to reshape the world using 12 children, whom he deems the \u201cperfect vessels\u201d because they\u2019re easy to control. To remake the world, Henry wants to merge Hawkins with another world called the Abyss.\n\nThis plan requires a tremendous amount of energy, and that\u2019s where the kids come in. When Vecna first took Will (Noah Schnapp) back in Season 1, he channeled his thoughts through the boy to amplify his power. Now he\u2019s going to do the same with Holly (Nell Fisher), Derek (Jake Connelly), and the other children he kidnaps at the end of Volume 1.\n\nIn Episode 5, Henry frames his sinister plan as a last resort to save the world. \u201cAn evil darkness is spreading across not just Hawkins, but the whole world, and soon it will be too late to stop it,\u201d he tells the children in Camazotz. He compares the darkness to the \u201cblack thing\u201d in Madeleine L\u2019Engle\u2019s *A Wrinkle in Time* \u2014 the classic novel Holly is reading throughout Season 5. Henry notes, \u201cJust as the black thing threatened Meg\u2019s family, so does the darkness threaten yours. But I believe I have found a way to defeat this darkness.\u201d\n\nAfter traveling \u201cfar and long, beyond our dimension,\u201d Henry says that he\u2019s discovered another world that is like Earth \u2014 only free of monsters and darkness. \u201cIt is the light,\u201d he says. Like the character Meg in *A Wrinkle in Time*, the 12 children he handpicked have special powers. These powers are dormant and can be awakened if they all work together. When the kids channel this energy they can draw in the new world \u2014 \u201cthe light will expel the darkness\u201d and their loved ones will be saved.\n\n## Related Stories\n\n* [When Does the *Stranger Things 5* Finale Come Out?](/tudum/features/stranger-things-season-5-release-date)\n\n  Dec. 27\n* Explainer\n\n  [*Stranger Things 5* Episode 8 Ending Explained: What Happens to the Hawkins Crew?](/tudum/articles/stranger-things-5-episode-8-ending-explained)\n\n  Yesterday 6:17 pm\n* Trailer\n\n  [Watch the Explosive *Stranger Things 5* Finale Trailer](/tudum/articles/stranger-things-5-finale-trailer)\n\n  Dec. 30\n* Music\n\n  [How the Duffer Brothers Scored Two Prince Songs for the *Stranger Things* Finale](/tudum/articles/stranger-things-5-episode-8-prince-needle-drop-songs)\n\n  6:05 am\n\n### So, what exactly is the Upside Down?\n\nThroughout *Stranger Things*, our beloved Hawkins crew assumed that the Upside Down was an alternate dimension opened by Dr. Brenner (Matthew Modine), where terrifying creatures like Demogorgons, Demodogs, and Demobats call home. That notion is flipped, well, upside down at the end of Episode 5 when we learn what it *really* is.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not another world. It\u2019s a wormhole,\u201d Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo) tells Steve (Joe Keery). \u201cA bridge between two points in time and space, between our world and another.\u201d\n\n### What\u2019s the Abyss?\n\nThe Abyss is an alternate dimension connected to Earth via the Upside Down, a kind of interdimensional bridge. In Episode 7, Dustin names this other world after the realm of chaos and evil in Dungeons & Dragons.\n\nThe Abyss, not the Upside Down, is where Eleven banished Henry after [eviscerating him in the Rainbow Room](https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/stranger-things-season-4-recap) in Season 4. Henry would have remained lost had Dr. Brenner not forced Eleven to search for him in a sensory-deprivation tank known as \u201cthe bath.\u201d When Eleven eventually made remote contact with the Abyss, the Upside Down was formed. Ever since, \u201cHenry and his monsters have been using it to cross right back into Hawkins,\u201d Dustin explains in Episode 7.\n\nIt is the other world that Vecna plans to merge with Earth.\n\n### What is exotic matter? And what\u2019s on the other side of that giant flesh wall?\n\nIn the 1983 film *Star Wars: Return of the Jedi*, rebel forces find it difficult to attack the Death Star II because it\u2019s protected by a giant energy shield powered by a shield generator. In *Stranger Things*, Dustin initially believes the flesh wall surrounding the Upside Down is Vecna\u2019s version of that \u2014 powered by Vecna\u2019s dark magic \u2014\u00a0and that the giant sphere above the lab must be the energy shield generator.\n\nWhat he learns from Dr. Brenner\u2019s journals is that the sphere isn\u2019t made of dark magic after all. It\u2019s actually composed of exotic matter, a single source of energy holding that flesh wall together. In other words, that sphere is the power source keeping the whole Upside Down intact. Destroying it would mean wiping out the wormhole, along with everything and everyone in it.\n\nSo, what\u2019s on the other side of that massive flesh wall? Nothing. Or, as Dustin puts it, \u201cdeath.\u201d\n\n### But why didn\u2019t the Upside Down fully collapse?\n\nWhen Nancy (Natalia Dyer) shoots at the sphere in Episode 5, she sets off a sonic blast that is absorbed by the wall and results in everything in the wall\u2019s path being sucked into a void. At the same time, parts of Hawkins Lab start melting, turning into gray sludge, including the rooftop that Nancy and Jonathan (Charlie Heaton) were standing on.\n\nEleven, Hopper (David Harbour), and Kali evade being pulled into the black void \u2014\u00a0unlike Steve\u2019s cherished BMW \u2014\u00a0when Eleven creates a force field that clears a path for them to slip through a rift and back to the real world.\n\nStill, the Upside Down remains. That\u2019s because the exotic matter \u201cwasn\u2019t completely destroyed,\u201d Dustin notes, but it was \u201cvery clearly disturbed.\u201d\n\n### How does the crew plan to stop Vecna?\n\nDefeating Vecna is the toughest challenge our heroes have ever faced, and it\u2019s not just because he\u2019s a walking nightmare. As Mike (Finn Wolfhard) points out, the crew must figure out how to \u201cget 2,000 feet in the air, find our way into the Abyss, free Holly and the kids, and kill Vecna \u2014 all before our worlds merge.\u201d\n\nAfter Hopper proposes an impractical plan involving kidnapping someone to fly a helicopter, Steve comes up with a bold idea that the crew later calls \u201cOperation Beanstalk.\u201d\n\nSince they can\u2019t reach the Abyss from the tower \u2014\u00a0the only way to access that other world is through the Upside Down sky \u2014\u00a0he suggests they let Vecna draw the two worlds together and wait until the Squawk radio tower pokes through one of the rifts, so Eleven can make her move. \u201cShe does her meditation thingy, enters Vecna\u2019s sick mind, and ambushes him,\u201d Steve explains. That would stop the spell, halting the worlds from moving, and creating a \u201cbeanstalk\u201d where our heroes can climb into the Abyss to rescue the kids.\n\nKeery, who plays Steve, thought it was \u201cfun\u201d that his character plays such a critical role in the final plan. \u201cMy character is usually an observer in these scenes and is usually a piece of the puzzle, but not necessarily the person who\u2019s coming up with the plan.\u201d\n\nMatarazzo calls it an important moment because \u201cSteve never really believes that he\u2019s very smart, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true.\u201d\n\nTo get around the issue of Eleven being too far away from Vecna, Nancy floats the idea of using the bath at Hawkins Lab in the Upside Down, which is right underneath his lair. Max then volunteers to guide Eleven through Henry\u2019s mind since she knows it inside out, and Kali offers to follow Eleven into his mind to help her fight their brother.\n\nAnd it\u2019s Dustin who formulates the last part of the plan: On their way out, they plant a bomb near the exotic matter, set a timer, and escape the Upside Down. When the bridge collapses, so does everything with it, including the Abyss, the Mind Flayer, and all of Vecna\u2019s monsters.\n\n### What does Dr. Kay want with Kali? And why is she after Eleven?\n\nIn Episode 5, Kali details how the military murdered her friends, took her captive, and shaved her head \u2014 a moment that Berthelsen asked the Duffer Brothers be acted out on camera. The *Stranger Things* co-creators added the head-shaving scene to the script, and co-department head of hair Brynn Berg performed the cutting of Berthelsen\u2019s tresses in the episode. \u201cI know this is not an easy thing to do,\u201d Berthelsen notes. \u201cWe had to do it in one take, so it had to work.\u201d\n\nKali also reveals that Dr. Kay (Linda Hamilton) kept her alive and drugged in an effort to restart Dr. Brenner\u2019s secret government program by infusing pregnant women with Kali\u2019s blood. Although the children in Brenner\u2019s original experiment received their powers from Henry\u2019s blood, they were all \u201cpale imitations,\u201d so Kali\u2019s blood just isn\u2019t working.\n\n\u201cOnly one of us,\u201d Kali notes, \u201cwas truly like him.\u201d Eleven. Dr. Kay needs Eleven to create more super-powered kids, which is why the military scientist is so desperate to find her.\n\nBut destroying Dr. Kay\u2019s lab along with the Upside Down is only a temporary solution. Dr. Kay will only replace her lab, Kali says, and killing her would just lead to another scientist replacing her. Kali believes that if Eleven runs away with Mike as planned, the military will eventually find her and use her blood to create more children, opening up more gates and more worlds in a vicious cycle. The only way to stop it, she posits, is for them to stay on the bridge when it blows up. They must vanish along with the Upside Down.\n\n### What happened to Max and Holly in Camazotz?\n\nAfter being chased \u2014 and nearly caught \u2014\u00a0by Henry through a few unsettling memories in Camazotz, Holly and Max (Sadie Sink) stumble upon an old shaft just beyond the cave and right into the traumatic memory that keeps Henry at bay.\n\nIn this vision, they see a frantic scientist shoot an 8-year-old Henry in the hand out of fear, believing that someone has sent the boy after him. Before he can fire off a second shot, young Henry fights for control of the gun and ends up bludgeoning the man to death with a rock.\n\nFollowing the faint sounds of Kate Bush\u2019s \u201cRunning Up That Hill (a Deal with God)\u201d behind a wall of boulders in that shaft, Max and Holly dig their way through and find an exit in a familiar place: the red void. Max, realizing the portal showing Lucas (Caleb McLaughlin) carrying her on the other side is her way out and not Holly\u2019s, offers sage advice.\n\n\u201cMusic isn\u2019t the only way back,\u201d Max says. \u201cYou just need something that connects you to the real world.\u201d Something like Holly the Brave, the Dungeons & Dragons figurine that her brother, Mike, gives to her in Volume 1.\n\nWhat makes this moment special for Sink, who plays Max, is that the pair share an \u201cintense journey\u201d in the first two volumes of Season 5. \u201cTo pause at such a climactic point and have Max express to Holly everything that she\u2019s picked up on about her and give her that little pep talk, it meant a lot,\u201d Sink says.\n\n### Does Max finally wake from her coma?\n\nYes! After nearly two years of being comatose, Max opens her eyes and Lucas is right at her side.\n\nMcLaughlin recalls that just before filming Lucas and Max\u2019s emotional reunion, the energy of the room had shifted. \u201cI remember Shawn [Levy, the director] calling action, and then the energy switched, and then I looked into Sadie\u2019s eyes,\u201d he says.\n\nWhen they finished the scene, \u201ceveryone was quiet. Then Maya [Hawke] and Amy [beth McNulty] started crying. Then Sadie [Sink] started crying. Then I started crying. Everyone just felt the presence of what we brought to the table.\u201d\n\n### Wait, where did Holly end up? Is that where the children are being physically held?\n\nAfter escaping Camazotz, Holly wakes up in the Abyss, the alternate dimension that\u2019s connected to Earth by the Upside Down. Holly and the other children are entombed in the spires of what\u2019s called the Pain Tree, where they\u2019re being pumped with Mind Flayer particles through vines that are attached to Vecna and the giant beating heart above him.\n\nWhat Holly sees outside the Pain Tree is just as horrifying: a stormy yellow sky and a seemingly endless terrain of rocky canyons and boulders.\n\nWhen Vecna chases after Holly, she slips through a rift and falls through the sky into the Upside Down. But Vecna catches her midair before she hits the ground and returns her to the Pain Tree, placing her mind back in Camazotz.\n\n### Do Nancy and Jonathan break up?\n\nThere are things between Nancy and Jonathan that have been left unsaid since Season 4, and they haven\u2019t been on the same page for quite some time. But when Nancy fires a shot that disturbs the sphere, the pair end up trapped in a room rapidly flooding with gray sludge and finally have that long-awaited conversation.\n\n\u201cThey assume, understandably, that that\u2019s the end,\u201d Shawn Levy, who directed Episodes 6 and 7, says. \u201cThey end up having a [moment] filled with a level of honesty that is an all-timer of a Jonathan\u2013Nancy scene.\u201d\n\nNancy admitting she hates the band The Clash spurs Jonathan to reveal that he hates reading her articles. That opens the floodgates for even more confessions, like that Jonathan never applied to Emerson College (which Nancy already knew about) and that Nancy didn\u2019t visit him in California because she needed space.\n\nIn one last confession, Jonathan shows Nancy the engagement ring he\u2019s been carrying inside a John Coltrane cassette and offers a different kind of proposal: to *not* marry him.\n\n\u201cI tried to convince myself that this would somehow fix everything, but it was just gonna make things worse,\u201d he says, \u201cwhich is why it has been sitting like a cannonball in my pocket for the last two days. So, what do you say? Do you accept my un-proposal?\u201d\n\nNancy accepts, and it\u2019s after Jonathan tosses the ring away that they notice the sludge has solidified. They survived, but the same can\u2019t be said for their romance.\n\n### Do Dustin and Steve make up?\n\nThe tension brewing between Dustin and Steve reaches a boiling point in Episode 5 when they argue over Steve\u2019s lack of support for Dustin\u2019s shield-generator theory. When Steve brings up Eddie (Joseph Quinn), who died in Season 4, their verbal fight escalates to a full-on physical altercation.\n\n\u201cDeep down, the reason you\u2019re so goddamned pissed is because you know the truth,\u201d Steve tells him. \u201cEddie wanted to play hero, and he made a dumb call, and he got himself killed.\u201d That sets Dustin off, and he starts swinging at Steve while Steve desperately tries to calm him down.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that the arguing buds still care about each other, though, when Steve attempts to traverse a giant hole in the unstable Hawkins Lab floor to rescue their friends, and Dustin begs him not to do it. \u201cYou\u2019re always trying to get yourself killed, and I can\u2019t let it happen again,\u201d Dustin pleads, earning a hug in return.\n\nLater, when Dustin hands Steve the sphere and shield that had belonged to Eddie ahead of the final battle, Steve apologizes for the awful things he said and admits he was angry because he missed his best friend. Dustin\u2019s offering is \u201clike calling a truce,\u201d Keery notes. It gives Steve a \u201cmoment of pause,\u201d which spurs his apology.\n\nMatarazzo says the heart-rending exchange is a \u201cneeded moment\u201d between the pair, allowing them to \u201cexpress to each other what they\u2019ve wanted to say for a long time.\u201d\n\n### How does Mr. Clarke finally learn about the Upside Down?\n\nIn Episode 6, Erica (Priah Ferguson) and her \u201cbabysitter,\u201d Murray (Brett Gelman), recruit science teacher Mr. Clarke (Randy Havens) to help build another telemetry tracker so they can find Dustin and the others in the Upside Down.\n\nStill out of the loop about all the supernatural occurrences in Hawkins, Mr. Clarke pinpoints Dustin\u2019s exact location to Hawkins Lab. When Eleven uses her powers to remove the metal plate covering a rift, Mr. Clarke not only learns about the Upside Down firsthand but enters the interdimensional bridge with the crew to locate the rest of the party.\n\n### Does Will come out to his friends?\n\nYes, and it's prompted by a major setback. When Will once again taps into the hive mind, he briefly takes control of Vecna \u2014 only for Vecna to boot him out, sending him into a comatose state. While physically unresponsive at the Squawk, Will\u2019s consciousness is trapped in Vecna\u2019s mindscape, where Vecna uses his \u201cspy\u201d to pry into Will\u2019s head, with the aim of discovering Max\u2019s physical location so that the monster can find and kill her.\n\nOpening up to his mother, Joyce (Winona Ryder), in Episode 7, Will explains how Vecna got into his mind and used his secrets against him. To beat Vecna, he needs to confess something not just to his mother, but to the entire crew.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t told any of you this because I don\u2019t want you to see me differently. But the truth is, I am different,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m like you in almost every way \u2026. I don\u2019t like girls. I mean, I do. Just not like you guys do.\u201d Will harbored a crush on someone, he says, \u201ceven though I know they\u2019re not like me,\u201d before realizing that person is \u201cjust my Tammy\u201d \u2014\u00a0a callback to [Robin\u2019s speech in Episode 4](https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/stranger-things-5-noah-schnapp-interview) about having a crush on her classmate Tammy.\n\nIn Vecna\u2019s mindscape, the monster showed Will a future where some of his friends are so worried that it makes him feel \u201clike something\u2019s wrong with me,\u201d so he pushes them away. Other friends simply drift away, leaving him all alone. And while none of that had actually happened, the scary thought \u201cjust felt so real.\u201d\n\nAfter Will\u2019s moving speech, he finds unwavering support from his friends and family. One by one, they promise he won\u2019t lose them, and they all come together in a giant group hug.\n\nWill\u2019s coming out was \u201csomething that we\u2019d been building to for a very long time,\u201d Ross Duffer says. \u201cIt\u2019s important that he comes to terms with this, and once he\u2019s able to do that, he\u2019s heading into this final battle with a confidence and maturity that he hasn\u2019t had before.\u201d'\n\n### Does anyone die in *Stranger Things 5*, Volume 2?\n\nNope!

The following contains details from the series finale of\u00a0[\"Stranger Things\":](https://www.netflix.com/browse?jbv=80057281)\u00a0\"The Rightside Up.\"***\n\nIn the end, 99% of our Hawkins heroes got the happy ending they deserved.\n\nActually, maybe 100%.\n\nAs the fifth and final season of [\"Stranger Things\"](/story/entertainment/tv/2025/12/25/stranger-things-season-5-ep-7-recap-the-bridge/87881306007/) sped toward its [New Year's Eve finale episode](/story/entertainment/tv/2025/12/31/stranger-things-series-finale-recap-the-rightside-up/87978152007/), fans speculated about who would live and die. Would the beloved Steve Harrington live to see another day with his partner in crime, Dustin Henderson? Would Will and Eleven make it out alive after a faceoff with Vecna?\n\nThe sci-fi series, created by Matt and Ross Duffer, has never shied away from [killing characters](/story/entertainment/tv/2025/12/26/tv-deaths-2025-ranked-last-of-us/87588124007/), from poor Barb Holland (Shannon Purser) in Season 1 and the brotherly villain Billy Hargrove (Dacre Montgomery) in Season 3 to fan favorite Eddie Munson (Joseph Quinn) in Season 4.\n\nSo it's with probably a lot of shock that the series ended mostly bloodlessly, with only poor Kali/Eight (Linnea Berthelsen) and villainous Vecna (Jamie Campbell Bower) confirmed to have perished in the finale episode. Kali dies at the hands of one of Dr. Kay's (Linda Hamilton) cruel soldiers, who despises her and El for their supernatural powers. Vecna and his Mind Flayer conspirator are killed by Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown) and the rest of the gang in a big battle sequence that ends with the veiny villain skewered on a spike. He's not quite dead after that, though, and it's Joyce Byers (Winona Ryder), who deals a series of fatal blows with an axe, beheading the monster once known as Henry Creel. She even gets a cheesy line before she does it.\n\nBut one question is lingering.\n\n## Does Eleven die in the 'Stranger Things' series finale?\n\nFor the final few episodes of the series, Eleven has been reckoning with a life-and-death dilemma. Rescuing Kali from Dr. Kay's lab led her to discover that the evil scientist is trying to create more super-powered kids to fight the Russians (of course) by using Kali and El's blood. Kali wants them both to sacrifice themselves in the name of ending the cycle for good.\n\nEl fights with both surrogate dad Hopper (David Harbour) and boyfriend Mike (Finn Wolfhard) about this over the course of the episode. After it seems like our heroes have won the day and get to ride off into the sunset, they are captured by Dr. Kay and her minions. But somehow Eleven isn't among the detainees.\n\nInstead, she's suddenly standing at the gate to the Upside Down, which is about to be destroyed forever by a bomb Hopper and Murray (Brett Gelman) set.\n\nAfter a quick psychic conference with Mike, and a goodbye kiss set to \"Purple Rain\" by Prince, El is blown up with the Upside Down, and the gate to a wormhole and other worlds is closed for good. The show flashes forward 18 months to Hawkins, Indiana, being rebuilt as an idyllic version of Small Town America.\n\nEverybody is mostly happy and attempting to move on \u2212 except for Mike. As he continues to grapple with his grief and almost skips out on his high school graduation, Hopper has a heart to heart with him and convinces him to show up. At the end of the ceremony, Mike notices something in the feedback of the speakers at graduation that reminds him of the same noise used against El by the government bad guys.\n\n## Mike's theory about Eleven in 'Stranger Things' series finale\n\nLater in the day, while playing a final game of Dungeons & Dragons with Lucas, Will, Dustin and Max, Mike spins a story where El escaped and faked her death, with the help of Kali, whose superpowers involve illusions.\n\nIn his story, El is somewhere far away and safe, with three waterfalls. The scene flashes to an image of El, now with long hair and normal clothes, hiking up a stony mountain to a beautiful ridge overlooking waterfalls.\n\nMike and the rest of the crew don't know for certain if she's alive somewhere, and the show doesn't make it clear. There are a few things in favor of his theory. At the moment when El magically escaped the grip of the military, they were blasting the sort of kryptonite sound that causes her immense pain and blocks her ability to use her powers.\n\nThe El we saw standing in the gate to the Upside Down showed no evidence of (physical) pain. She seemed to disappear from the truck carrying everyone with remarkable speed. And her \"sister\" Kali seemed to show up in the season out of nowhere, after appearing before only in one widely-hated episode all the way back in Season 2. It's possible Kali was just a plot device to make Eleven's fate all the more ambiguous.\n\nBut whether or not she really survived can never be answered by what was shown on screen. Like Mike and his friends, fans will have to choose to believe it or not.\n\nAfter all, stranger things have happened.\n\nFeatured Weekly Ad",
